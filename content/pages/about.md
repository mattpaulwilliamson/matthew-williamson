My Name is Matthew Williamson, I am currently working at [comparethemarket.com](http://www.comparethemarket.com). 

I love working with technology and exploring the differnt ways to build stuff from process to coding. I enjoy learning which I am every day and help others to do the same.

I live in Peterborough with my partner and our three beautiful children.
