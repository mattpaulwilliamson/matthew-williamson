  Recently Nasa spotted a giant iceberg (around twice the size of New York) an
  estimated area of 1,700 sq. km, this is likely to break away from the
  mainland. This worries me as it feels like we as a world of people are not
  talking or working hard enough to look after the home we live in.

**I am concerned that some of the things I am doing are having a large effect on the planet. **

I work in tech as a software engineer, I know tech is helping out lots with the environment from electric cars to renewable energy, but I canâ€™t help but think of all the bad stuff it is doing to the world. I work on various projects that use lots of different npm modules, I am not fully clued up on how this happens in all the detail but there must be a cost somewhere to the environment every time I run a project install even if it is just the energy draining from the machine battery.

I did some research and came across this report from 2017 from Greenpeace and I was quite surprised by this data. It publishes companies and apps that are using clean/dirty energy.

Here you can sign a petition to send to Netflix to ask them to stop using dirty energy. This company is the biggest TV provider on the planet they have a duty to do things properly. They were not the only company using dirty energy.  

**What can we do about it?**

Every time you go to watch, stream or listen to something online, a phone will usually be more energy-efficient than a laptop or TV,  Terrestrial TV is also a lot more efficient than steaming. Take a look in more detail at the energy costs around the sites, services and tools you consume.
