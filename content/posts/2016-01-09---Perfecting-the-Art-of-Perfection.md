  Recently Nasa spotted a giant iceberg (around twice the size of New York) an
  estimated area of 1,700 sq. km, this is likely to break away from the
  mainland. This worries me as it feels like we as a world of people are not
  talking or working hard enough to look after the home we live in.

I have three children who will hopefully go on to have children and so on and I am concerned that some of the things I am currently doing and have done is having a large effect on the planet. 

I work in tech as a software engineer and I know tech is helping out with the environment, but I canâ€™t help but think of all the bad it is doing to it. I work on various projects that use lots of different npm modules I am not fully clued up on how this happens but there must be a cost somewhere to the environment every time I run a project install.

I did some research and came across this report from 2017 from Greenpeace and I was quite surprised by this data.It publishes the companies and apps that are using clean/dirty energy.

Here you can sign a petition to send to Netflix to ask them to stop using dirty energy. This company but be one of the biggest TV providers on the planet they have a duty as we all do to do things properly. 

**What can we do about it?**

Every time you go to watch, stream or listen to something online, a phone will usually be more energy-efficient than a laptop or TV,  Terrestrial TV is also a lot more efficient than steaming.
