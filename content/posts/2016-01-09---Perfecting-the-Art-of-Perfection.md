**The data centers that support the Internet use massive amounts of energy.**

Recently Nasa spotted a giant iceberg (around twice the size of New York), named B-46 this is supposedly going to break away sometime soon. This worries me as it feels like we as a world of people are not talking or working hard enough to look after the home we live in.

I have three children who will hopefully go on to have children and so on and I am concerned that some of the things I am currently doing and have done is having a large effect on the planet. 

I work in tech as a software engineer and I know tech is helping out with the environment, but I canâ€™t help but think of all the bad it is doing to it. I work on various projects that use lots of different npm modules I am not fully clued up on how this happens but there must be a cost somewhere to the environment every time I run a project install.

I did some research and came across this report from 2017 from Greenpeace and I was quite surprised by this data.It publishes the companies and apps that are using clean/dirty energy.

Here you can sign a petition to send to Netflix to ask them to stop using dirty energy. This company but be one of the biggest TV providers on the planet they have a duty as we all do to do things properly. 

**What can we do about it?**

Every time you go to watch, stream or listen to something online, a phone will usually be more energy-efficient than a laptop or TV,  Terrestrial TV is also a lot more efficient than steaming.
